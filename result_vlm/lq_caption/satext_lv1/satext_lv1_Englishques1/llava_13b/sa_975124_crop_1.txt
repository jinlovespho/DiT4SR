The image shows a close-up view of a car's steering wheel, with the driver's side airbag and a gear shift. The steering wheel is positioned in the center of the image, and the gear shift is located on the left side of the wheel. The car's interior is captured in a low-resolution photo, which makes it difficult to discern more details.
