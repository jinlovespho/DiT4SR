The image features a large airplane with a pink and white color scheme. The airplane is parked on the runway, and there are several orange cones placed around it. The cones are likely there to guide the plane and ensure its safe movement on the tarmac. The airplane's design and the presence of the cones suggest that it is a commercial airliner.
