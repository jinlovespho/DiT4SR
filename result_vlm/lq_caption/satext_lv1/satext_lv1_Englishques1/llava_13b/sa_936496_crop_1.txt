The image features a large blue and white airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane is positioned under a building, which could be a terminal or a hangar. The airplane's tail is visible, and it appears to be a large jetliner.

There are several people in the scene, likely airport staff or passengers. Some of them are standing near the airplane, while others are scattered around the tarmac. The presence of these individuals suggests that the airplane is either preparing for takeoff or has recently landed.
