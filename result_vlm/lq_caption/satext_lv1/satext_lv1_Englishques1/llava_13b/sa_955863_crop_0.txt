The image features a beach scene with a woman in a yellow shirt standing on a surfboard in the water. She is holding a sail attached to a surfboard, possibly preparing for windsurfing or kiteboarding. There are several other people in the scene, some of them closer to the water's edge, while others are further away.

In addition to the people and the woman with the sail, there are a few cars parked nearby, and a couple of umbrellas set up on the beach. The umbrellas are positioned at different spots, providing shade for beachgoers.
