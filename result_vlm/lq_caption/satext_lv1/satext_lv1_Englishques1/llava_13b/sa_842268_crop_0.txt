The image features two boats docked next to each other in a body of water. One of the boats is a large boat, while the other is a smaller boat. The smaller boat is positioned in front of the larger boat, and both boats are tied up to a dock.

There are several people visible in the scene, with one person standing near the smaller boat and two others standing closer to the larger boat. Additionally, there is a chair located near the smaller boat, possibly for someone to sit and enjoy the view.
