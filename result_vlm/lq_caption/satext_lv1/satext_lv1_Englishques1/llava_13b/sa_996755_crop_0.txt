The image features a large body of water with a city skyline in the background. The city skyline is dominated by a tall building, which stands out among the other structures. There are several boats on the water, with some of them closer to the foreground and others further away.

In addition to the boats, there are a few people scattered around the scene, likely enjoying the view or engaging in water-related activities. The combination of the water, boats, and city skyline creates a picturesque and lively atmosphere.
