The image features a vintage car driving down a street, possibly participating in a parade. The car is an old-fashioned convertible with a number 18 on the side. There are several people around the car, some of them standing close to the vehicle, while others are further away.

In addition to the car, there are two bicycles in the scene, one located near the left side of the image and the other closer to the center. A chair can also be seen in the background, possibly placed for spectators to sit and enjoy the event.
