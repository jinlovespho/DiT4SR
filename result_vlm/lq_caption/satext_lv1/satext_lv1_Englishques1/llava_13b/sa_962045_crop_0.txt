The image features a brick building with a clock mounted on its side. The clock is positioned in the middle of the building, and it appears to be an old-fashioned design. The building also has a castle-like appearance, with a brick facade and a clock tower. There are two flags hanging from the building, adding to its historical and architectural charm.
