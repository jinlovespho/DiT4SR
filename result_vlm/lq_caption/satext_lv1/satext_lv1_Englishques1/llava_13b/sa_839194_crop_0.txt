The image features a large building situated next to a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The building appears to be a restaurant or a hotel, as there are several dining tables and chairs visible on the deck. The tables and chairs are arranged in various positions, some closer to the water and others further away.

In addition to the dining area, there are a few cars parked nearby, and a person can be seen standing close to the water. The scene is set during the evening, with the sun setting and casting a warm glow over the area.
