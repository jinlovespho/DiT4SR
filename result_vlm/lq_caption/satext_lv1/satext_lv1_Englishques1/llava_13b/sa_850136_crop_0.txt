The image features a large gray naval ship floating on the water. The ship is surrounded by several smaller boats, with one boat positioned close to the left side of the ship and another boat on the right side. There are also two boats located further away from the main ship.

In addition to the boats, there are numerous people visible in the scene, likely crew members or passengers on the ships. Some of them are standing on the deck of the main ship, while others are scattered around the smaller boats. The presence of people and boats suggests that this could be a naval exercise or a gathering of ships for a specific purpose.
