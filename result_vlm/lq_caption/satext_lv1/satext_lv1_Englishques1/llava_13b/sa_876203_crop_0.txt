The image features a large boat, possibly a ferry, floating on a body of water. The boat is quite large, occupying a significant portion of the scene. There is another smaller boat visible in the water, positioned towards the right side of the image.

In the background, there are several buildings, indicating that the boat is likely in a harbor or near a city. The presence of these buildings suggests that the boat may be used for transportation or tourism purposes.
