The image features a large white cruise ship, the Norwegian Escape, floating on the water. The ship is quite large, occupying most of the frame. The ship's name is prominently displayed on the side of the vessel.

There are several people visible on the ship, with some standing near the top of the ship and others scattered around the deck. The passengers seem to be enjoying their time on the cruise ship, taking in the sights and experiences it has to offer.
