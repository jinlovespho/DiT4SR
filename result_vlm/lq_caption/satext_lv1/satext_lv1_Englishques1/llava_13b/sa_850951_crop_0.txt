The image shows a group of people walking down a street under a bridge. There are at least six people visible in the scene, with some walking closer to the bridge and others further away. The street appears to be a pedestrian-friendly area, as there are no cars in the image.

In addition to the people, there are two benches in the scene, one located near the left side of the image and the other closer to the right side. A handbag can also be seen in the scene, possibly belonging to one of the pedestrians.
