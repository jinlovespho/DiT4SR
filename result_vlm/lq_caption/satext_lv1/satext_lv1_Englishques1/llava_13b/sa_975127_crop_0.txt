The image features a white coffee cup placed on a wooden table. Next to the cup, there is a pen and a small orange box, which appears to be a pack of cards. The pen is positioned on the table, close to the cup and the box. The scene suggests a casual setting where someone might be taking a break or preparing to use the pen and cards.
