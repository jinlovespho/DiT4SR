The image shows a group of people walking down a street, with one person holding a sign that reads "St. Michael Penampang." The sign is blue and white, and it appears to be a banner. There are several people in the scene, some of them walking in the background, while others are closer to the foreground. The group seems to be participating in an event or gathering, possibly related to the sign they are carrying.
