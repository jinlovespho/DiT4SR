The image features a large white airplane parked on the tarmac. The airplane is a Lufthansa jet, and it is connected to a boarding ramp. There are several people around the airplane, likely working on the ground or preparing for boarding.

In addition to the airplane and people, there are two trucks visible in the scene. One truck is located near the left side of the airplane, while the other truck is situated further to the right. The presence of these vehicles suggests that the airplane is being serviced or prepared for its next flight.
