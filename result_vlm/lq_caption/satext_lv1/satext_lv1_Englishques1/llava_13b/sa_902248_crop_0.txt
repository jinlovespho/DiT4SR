The image features a boat floating on a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The boat is large and appears to be a ferry or a barge. There are several people on the boat, with some standing near the front and others scattered throughout the vessel. The boat is also equipped with a few chairs, which are placed in different areas of the boat. The scene captures the essence of a leisurely boat ride or a transportation service on the water.
