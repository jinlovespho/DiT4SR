The image features a large stone archway with a clock on it. The clock is positioned towards the top of the archway, and it appears to be a prominent feature of the structure. The clock is surrounded by a stone frame, which adds to the overall grandeur of the archway. The scene is set against a blue sky, which contrasts beautifully with the stone structure.
