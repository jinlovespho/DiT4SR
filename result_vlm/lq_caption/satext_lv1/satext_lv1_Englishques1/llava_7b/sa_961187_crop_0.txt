The image features a red car parked in front of a white building. The car is positioned near the center of the scene, and there are several potted plants placed around the area. Some of these plants are located near the car, while others are scattered throughout the scene.

In addition to the car and potted plants, there are two benches visible in the image. One bench is located on the left side of the scene, and the other is situated on the right side. The presence of these benches suggests that the area might be a public space or a place where people can sit and relax.
