The image features a white boat docked in a harbor. The boat is situated in the middle of the scene, and it appears to be a small yacht. There are several people in the vicinity of the boat, with one person standing close to the left side of the boat and two others standing further away on the right side.

In addition to the boat and people, there are two cars visible in the scene. One car is located on the left side of the boat, while the other car is parked on the right side. The presence of these vehicles suggests that the harbor is a popular spot for both boating and land transportation.
