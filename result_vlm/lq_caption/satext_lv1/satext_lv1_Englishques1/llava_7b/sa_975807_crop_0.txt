The image depicts a city street with a row of potted plants lining the sidewalk. There are five potted plants in total, with one on the left side, two in the middle, and two on the right side of the street. The street is situated between two buildings, one of which is red and appears to be a restaurant.

In addition to the potted plants, there are two people visible in the scene. One person is located near the center of the image, while the other person is standing closer to the right side of the street. A car can also be seen parked on the right side of the street.
