The image features a vintage car with a driver and a passenger. The car is driving down a street, and there are several people standing on the sidewalk, watching the car pass by. Some of the people are closer to the car, while others are further away.

In addition to the car and the people, there are two bicycles in the scene. One bicycle is located near the left side of the image, and the other is positioned more towards the center. The presence of these bicycles suggests that the area might be a popular spot for cycling or that the people standing on the sidewalk are using bicycles as their mode of transportation.
