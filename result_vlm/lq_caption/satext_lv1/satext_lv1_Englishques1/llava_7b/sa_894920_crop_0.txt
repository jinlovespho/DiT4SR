The image features a city street with a row of parked cars on the side of the road. There are several cars of different sizes, with some parked closer to the foreground and others further back. A fire hydrant can be seen on the sidewalk, and a potted plant is placed nearby.

In addition to the cars, there are two people visible in the scene, one standing closer to the left side of the image and the other near the center. A clock is also present on the left side of the image, possibly indicating the time for passersby.
