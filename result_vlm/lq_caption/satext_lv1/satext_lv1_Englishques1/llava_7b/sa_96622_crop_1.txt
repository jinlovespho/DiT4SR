The image features a large white airplane parked on the tarmac. The airplane is a Lufthansa jet, and it is positioned on the runway. There are several people visible in the scene, with some standing near the airplane and others scattered around the tarmac.

A truck can be seen in the background, likely used for transporting luggage or other cargo. The presence of people and the truck suggests that the airplane is either preparing for takeoff or has recently landed, and ground crew is working to load or unload the aircraft.
