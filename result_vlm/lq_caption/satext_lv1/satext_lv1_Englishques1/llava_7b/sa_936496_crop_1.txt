The image features a large airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane has a blue and white color scheme, and its tail is painted with a blue and white design. The airplane is positioned under a large building, which could be a terminal or a hangar.

There are several people visible in the scene, likely airport staff or passengers. Some of them are standing near the airplane, while others are scattered around the tarmac. The presence of people and the airplane's location under the building suggest that the airplane is either preparing for takeoff or has recently landed.
