The image features a large, old military helicopter parked in a hangar. The helicopter is positioned in the center of the scene, with its wings spread out. The helicopter appears to be in a state of disrepair, possibly due to its age and the fact that it is no longer in active service.

In the background, there is a person standing near the right side of the image, possibly observing the helicopter or attending to it. The overall atmosphere of the scene suggests a sense of history and the passage of time.
