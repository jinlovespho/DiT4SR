The image features a large white and yellow airplane with the words "Mongolian" written on its side. The airplane is parked on the runway, and its engine is visible in the foreground. There are several people in the scene, some of them standing near the airplane, while others are scattered around the area. The presence of multiple people suggests that this could be a busy airport or a location where people are gathered for a specific event or purpose.
