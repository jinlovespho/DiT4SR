The image features a street scene with a red and white traffic sign on a pole. The sign is positioned on the side of the road, and it appears to be a yield sign. The street is lined with buildings, and there are a few cars parked along the side.

In addition to the traffic sign, there are two parking meters visible in the scene. One is located near the center of the image, while the other is situated closer to the right side. A person can be seen standing near the left edge of the image, possibly waiting to cross the street or just observing the surroundings.
