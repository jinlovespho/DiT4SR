The image features a large Delta airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane is surrounded by several trucks, including a truck on the left side, another truck on the right side, and a third truck further back. There are also two people visible in the scene, one near the center of the image and another closer to the right side. The airplane appears to be in the process of being loaded or unloaded, with the trucks likely assisting in the transportation of luggage or cargo.
