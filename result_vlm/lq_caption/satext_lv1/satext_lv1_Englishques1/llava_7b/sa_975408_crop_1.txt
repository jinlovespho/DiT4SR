The image features a red carriage with two red wheels, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The carriage appears to be old and possibly abandoned. There is a bottle placed on the ground near the left wheel, and a cup can be seen on the ground near the right wheel. The scene gives off a sense of nostalgia and a connection to the past.
