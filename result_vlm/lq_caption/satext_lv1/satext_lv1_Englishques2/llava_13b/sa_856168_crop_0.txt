The image features a harbor with several boats docked in the water. There are at least nine boats visible in the scene, with some of them being closer to the shore and others further out in the water. The boats vary in size and are scattered throughout the harbor.

In the background, there is a city with buildings and a castle-like structure. The cityscape adds to the picturesque scene of the harbor.
