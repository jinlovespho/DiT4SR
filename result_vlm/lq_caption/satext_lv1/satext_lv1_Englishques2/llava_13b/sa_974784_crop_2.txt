The image features a blurry sign in front of a building, which is likely a restaurant. The sign is written in English and is placed on a pole. The building itself has a stone exterior, and the sign is positioned near the entrance. The blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern specific details, but the presence of the sign and the building's exterior are the main focus of the scene.
