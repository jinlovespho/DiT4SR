The image features a harbor with several boats docked in the water. There is a boat with a red pole sticking out of the water, and another boat with a red pole in the background. The boats are parked in the water, and there is a pier nearby.

In the scene, there are also a few people present, possibly enjoying the view or attending to their boats. The image is blurry, but the boats and people are still visible, creating a lively atmosphere at the harbor.
