The image features a marina with several boats docked in the water. One of the boats is a small white boat with a person standing on it. The person appears to be wearing a life jacket, ensuring their safety while on the boat. The scene also includes a couple of other boats in the background, one of which is a larger white boat. The presence of the life jacket and the person on the boat suggests that they are either preparing for a boating activity or have just returned from one.
