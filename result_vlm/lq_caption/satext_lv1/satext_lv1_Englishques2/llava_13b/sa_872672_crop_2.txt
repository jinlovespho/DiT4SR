The image features a dining table with a white plate and a sign. The sign is placed on the table, and it appears to be a menu sign. The plate is positioned next to the sign, and there is a fork on the table as well. The table is set for a meal, and the presence of the menu sign suggests that the dishes being served are likely to be of Spanish origin.
