The image features a large group of blue and red boats, with some of them being canoes. The boats are parked next to each other, and they are tied up to a dock. There are several chairs scattered throughout the scene, with some of them being red. The chairs are placed near the boats, possibly for people to sit and enjoy the view or for the boat owners to relax.
