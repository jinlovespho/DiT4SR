The image is quite blurry, but it appears to show a building with some text on it. The text seems to be in a non-English script, possibly Cyrillic, and includes the word "RESTAURANT" which is partially visible at the top. Below that, there might be other words or numbers, but they are not clear due to the blurriness.
