The image shows a sign with some text that appears to be in English and possibly other languages. The visible text includes "A1" at the bottom right corner and what seems to be a route number "35" at the top left. There is also a red circle with a white "P" inside it, which typically indicates parking. The rest of the text is not clearly legible due to the blurriness.
