The image features a boat with the word "Motor" written on the side. The boat is docked in a body of water, possibly a lake or a river. The boat is positioned next to another boat, which is also visible in the scene. The presence of the word "Motor" suggests that the boat may be a motorboat, designed for propulsion by an engine.
