The image features a small town with a river running through it. The town has a few buildings, including a church, and a bridge that spans the river. There is a sign on the side of the river that reads "Walking Path."

In the foreground, there is a flock of birds, with at least 13 birds visible in the scene. The birds are scattered across the image, with some closer to the water and others further away. The combination of the town, river, and birds creates a picturesque and peaceful atmosphere.
