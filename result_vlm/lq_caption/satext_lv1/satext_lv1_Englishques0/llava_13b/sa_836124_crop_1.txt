The image features a large building with a green facade, which appears to be a museum. The building is situated next to a body of water, possibly a river. In front of the building, there is a boat floating on the water. The boat is positioned close to the building, and it seems to be a small, yellow boat. The scene creates a picturesque view of the museum and the waterfront.
