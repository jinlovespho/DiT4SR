The image features a restaurant with several tables and chairs set up under white umbrellas. The umbrellas are labeled with the word "Tysyke," which is likely the name of the restaurant. The tables are arranged in various positions, with some closer to the foreground and others further back.

There are numerous chairs placed around the tables, and some of them are empty. A few cups can be seen on the tables, possibly indicating that the restaurant is open and ready for customers. The overall atmosphere of the scene suggests a pleasant outdoor dining experience.
