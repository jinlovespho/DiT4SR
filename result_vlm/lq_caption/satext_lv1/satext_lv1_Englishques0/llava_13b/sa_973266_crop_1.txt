The image shows a group of people gathered around a fountain in a city square. There are at least six people in the scene, with some standing and others sitting on the steps of the fountain. One person is wearing a green jacket, and another person is wearing a pink jacket.

In the background, there is a building with a sign that reads "Banque Populaire." The people in the scene seem to be enjoying their time together, possibly socializing or taking a break from their daily activities.
