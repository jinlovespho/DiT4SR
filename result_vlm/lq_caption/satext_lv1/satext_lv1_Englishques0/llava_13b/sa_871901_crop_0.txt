The image features a purple banner with the words "Granite City" written on it. The banner is placed in front of a row of chairs, which are arranged in a semi-circle. There are a total of six chairs visible in the scene, with some chairs closer to the banner and others further away. The arrangement of the chairs and the banner suggests that this might be a seating area for an event or gathering.
