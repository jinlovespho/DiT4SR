The image features a skateboarder performing a trick in the air, with the skateboard visible beneath him. The skateboarder is in the middle of the scene, and there are two other people in the background, one on the left side and the other on the right side.

In the background, there is a large building with a logo on it. The logo is a combination of the letters "OS" and a picture of a skateboard. The skateboarder's trick is likely being performed in front of this building, which could be a skate park or a popular skateboarding spot.
