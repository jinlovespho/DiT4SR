The image features a large body of water with a city skyline in the background. The skyline is dominated by a tall building with the word "Coca-Cola" written on it. There are several boats on the water, including a group of three boats near the center of the scene.

In addition to the boats, there are a few people scattered around the water, possibly enjoying the view or engaging in water activities. The overall atmosphere of the scene is serene, with the city skyline providing a striking contrast to the calm water and the boats.
