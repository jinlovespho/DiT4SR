The image features a large building with a glass front, possibly a hospital or a commercial building. The building is situated next to a tree-lined street, and there are several trees in the foreground. The sky is visible in the background, creating a pleasant atmosphere.

There are two people in the scene, one standing closer to the left side of the image and the other person standing further to the right. The presence of these individuals suggests that the area might be a public space or a place where people gather.
