The image features an airport runway with a large airplane parked on the tarmac. The airplane is white and blue, and it has the word "Eurowings" written on its side. There are also two buses parked near the airplane, likely for transporting passengers.

In addition to the airplane and buses, there are several people scattered around the scene, possibly airport staff or passengers. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a busy airport environment.
