The image features a two-story building with a storefront. The storefront has a sign that reads "Wooden Duck." The building is made of wood and has a brick wall. There are several potted plants placed in front of the building, adding to the overall aesthetic.

In the scene, there is a car parked on the street, and a parking meter is visible nearby. The presence of the parking meter suggests that the area is designated for parking, and the car is parked legally.
