The image shows a street with several cars parked along the side. There are three black poles on the sidewalk, with one of them having a sign on it. The sign is white and has a red circle with a line through it, indicating a no-turning zone.

There are also three people walking on the sidewalk, with one person closer to the left side of the image, another person in the middle, and the third person on the right side. The scene captures a typical urban environment with parked cars and pedestrians going about their day.
