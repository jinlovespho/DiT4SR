The image features a small yellow boat with three people on board, enjoying a ride on a river. The boat is floating near the shore, where several people are standing and watching the boat go by. 

There are a few umbrellas in the scene, with one near the left side of the image, another in the middle, and the third one on the right side. A bench can be seen on the left side of the image, providing a place for people to sit and relax. 

In the background, there are a couple of cars parked, possibly belonging to the people who have come to enjoy the river view or the boat ride.
