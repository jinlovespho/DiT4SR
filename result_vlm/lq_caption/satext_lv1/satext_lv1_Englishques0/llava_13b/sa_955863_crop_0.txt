The image features a woman in a yellow shirt standing on a sailboard in the water. She is holding onto a sail, which is attached to a boat. There are several other people in the scene, some of them closer to the water's edge, and others further away.

In the background, there are a few cars parked, and a truck is visible on the left side of the image. The scene appears to be a beach or waterfront area where people are enjoying various water activities.
