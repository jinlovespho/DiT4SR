The image features a city with a canal running through it. There are several buildings lining the canal, and a sign is visible in the foreground. The sign reads "Cannaregio," which is likely the name of the area.

In addition to the buildings, there are a few boats in the water, with one boat located near the left side of the image, another in the middle, and a third boat towards the right side. The scene captures the essence of a bustling city with a picturesque waterway running through its heart.
