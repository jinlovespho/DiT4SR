The image shows a woman walking down a sidewalk in front of a large white building. She is carrying a handbag and appears to be enjoying her walk. There are several other people in the scene, some of them walking and others standing.

The building has a clock mounted on its side, and there are two benches visible in the area. One bench is located near the center of the scene, while the other is situated closer to the right side. The presence of multiple people and the clock on the building suggest that this location might be a popular spot for pedestrians to gather and pass the time.
