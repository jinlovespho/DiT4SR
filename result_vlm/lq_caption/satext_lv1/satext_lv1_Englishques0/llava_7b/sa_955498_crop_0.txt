The image features a restaurant with several tables and chairs set up outside. The tables are covered with white umbrellas, providing shade and protection from the elements. The umbrellas are labeled with the name "Tysyke," which is likely the name of the restaurant. The tables are arranged in various positions, with some closer to the foreground and others further back. The chairs are placed around the tables, ready for guests to sit and enjoy their meals.
