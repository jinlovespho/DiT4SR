The image shows a city street with a row of potted plants lining the sidewalks. There are three potted plants visible, with one on the left side of the street, another in the middle, and the third on the right side. The plants are placed in front of a building, adding a touch of greenery to the urban environment.

In addition to the potted plants, there are two people in the scene, one standing near the left side of the street and the other closer to the right side. A car is parked on the right side of the street, and a bicycle can be seen further down the road.
