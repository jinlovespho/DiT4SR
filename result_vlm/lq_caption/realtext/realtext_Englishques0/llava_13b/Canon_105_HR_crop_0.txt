The image shows a wall with several electrical outlets and wires. There are three outlets visible, with one located on the left side, another in the middle, and the third on the right side of the wall. The wires are connected to these outlets, and they appear to be black in color.

In addition to the outlets, there are two switches present in the scene. One switch is located near the left side of the wall, while the other is situated closer to the center. The switches are likely used to control the flow of electricity to the outlets.
