The image shows a stadium with a green sign on the wall. The sign is written in a foreign language, possibly Chinese. The stadium is filled with numerous chairs, arranged in rows, and some of them are empty. The chairs are placed all around the stadium, with some closer to the foreground and others further back. The overall atmosphere of the stadium appears to be empty and quiet.
