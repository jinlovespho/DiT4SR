[llava_7b]: The image is a close-up of a foreign language text, possibly Chinese, with a few English words visible. The text appears to be a foreign language sign or a piece of paper with writing on it. The English words include "CR," "Schenhen," and "Bay." The rest of the text is in a foreign language, making it difficult to understand without proper context or translation.

[llava_13b]: The image shows a white background with a foreign language written on it. The text appears to be in Chinese, as it is written in a non-Latin script. The writing is in a large font, covering most of the image. The content of the text is not clear, but it seems to be a foreign language or a symbol.
