[llava_7b]: The image is a close-up of a book cover, featuring the title "Physicist, for Altair 8800." The book appears to be about the physics field, and the title is written in a bold, capitalized font. The cover is brown, and the title is the main focus of the image.

[llava_13b]: Physicist, philosopher, and author.

[llava_7b]: The image is blurry, but it appears to be a book cover with the title "Physicist, for Albert Einstein." The text is written in a foreign language, but the title is in English.

[llava_13b]: The image is blurry, but it appears to be a book cover featuring the word "Physicist" in white text. The cover is brown, and the word "Physicist" is the main focus of the image.

[qwenvl_3b]: physicist, Alth

[qwenvl_7b]: The visible text in the image reads "physicist," followed by some partially obscured letters that appear to be "er Alth." The rest of the text is not clearly legible due to blurriness.
