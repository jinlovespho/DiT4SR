[llava_7b]: The text on the paper is in a foreign language.

[llava_13b]: The image is a page of a book written in a foreign language. The text is in Chinese characters, and there is no English text visible.

[qwenvl_3b]: The noise in the sound of the camera sensor is very serious.

[qwenvl_7b]: The method is also considered effective. In many cases, it is an important consideration.

[llava_7b]: The image is a close-up of a piece of paper with Chinese writing on it. The writing appears to be a mix of both English and Chinese characters. The paper is folded, and the writing is in a foreign language. The text is difficult to read due to the low resolution of the image.

[llava_13b]: The image shows a piece of paper with Chinese writing on it. The paper is white and has a lot of text written in Chinese characters. The text appears to be a mix of Chinese and English, with some sentences written in English. The paper is likely a document or a piece of literature that contains information in both languages.

[qwenvl_3b]: "噪声使得图像质量严重下降。""对于0.35微米的CMOS传感器技术大多能达到这个水平，但像素密度是芯片尺寸的函数。从理论上讲，一个一般认为是有效的参数，实际上是一个需要考虑的因素。例如，使用更先进的技术可以提高像素密度，从而改善图像质量。"

[qwenvl_7b]: anti-noise achieves the image quality of 0.35 cm CMOS sensor technology can reach this level. One method is to increase the chip size. The other is to use a larger pixel size, which is generally considered effective. In many cases, it is an important consideration when choosing a camera.

[llava_7b]: The image is blurry, but it appears to be a piece of paper with Chinese characters on it. There is no visible English text or characters in the image.

[llava_13b]: The image is a blurry page with a mix of English and Chinese characters. The English text reads "3.5 ml." The Chinese characters are spread across the page, with some appearing more prominent than others. The overall content of the image seems to be a combination of instructions or information in both languages.

[qwenvl_3b]: The image contains some text in Chinese, which appears to be discussing the quality of images produced by a camera sensor. The text mentions that for a 0.35 megapixel CMOS sensor, the noise level is relatively high, and it suggests that the noise level can be reduced by increasing the chip size. It also mentions that the noise level is generally not very high. The text seems to be discussing the factors affecting the quality of images captured by a camera sensor.

[qwenvl_7b]: The image contains Chinese text. There is no visible English text in the image.

[llava_7b]: CMAT

[llava_13b]: The image shows a piece of paper with Chinese writing on it. The writing appears to be in a foreign language, making it difficult to understand. The paper is white, and the writing covers most of the surface.

[qwenvl_3b]: "噪声使得图像质量严重下降。""对于0.35微米的CMOS传感器技术大多能达到这个水平，但像素密度是增加芯片尺寸的问题。从理论上来说，一个像素一般被认为是有效的。""这是一个需要考虑的因素，因为不同的技术有不同的像素密度。""例如，CMOS和CCD传感器的技术特点。"

[qwenvl_7b]: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"CMOS""technology""is""effective""in""many""cases""consideration""important""and""technology"
