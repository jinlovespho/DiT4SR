[llava_13b]: The image is blurry, but it appears to be a book or a piece of paper with Asian characters on it. The characters are written in a vertical line, and there is a black frame around the paper. The paper is placed on a wooden surface, and the overall scene is somewhat obscured by the blurriness.

[qwenvl_3b]: The image contains some text in English, but it is very blurry and difficult to read. The text appears to be fragmented and not fully legible. Here is what can be discerned:- "Gerald Ford" is partially visible.- There seems to be a mention of "President Gerald Ford."- The text also includes the word "Washington."Given the poor quality of the image, it's challenging to provide more specific details about the content.

[qwenvl_7b]: The image contains a mix of English and Chinese text. The English text appears to be part of a sentence that starts with "Good luck" followed by some words that are not fully visible due to blurriness. The Chinese text is written in black on a white background and seems to be a continuation of the message, possibly offering encouragement or advice.
