[llava_7b]: The image features a blurry advertisement for a product, possibly a coffee maker. The advertisement contains a large amount of text, which is difficult to read due to the blurriness. The text appears to be in a foreign language, but the main focus is on the product being advertised.

[llava_13b]: The blurry image features a sign with a lot of text, but the content is not discernible due to the blurriness. The sign is placed on a wall, and the text appears to be in English. The image also includes a picture of a bear, which is located towards the top left corner of the sign.

[qwenvl_3b]: The image is blurry and does not provide clear visibility of any text or characters. Therefore, I cannot describe the contents based on the visible text or characters in the image.

[qwenvl_7b]: The image contains some blurry text that appears to be in English. The words "With Every Design" and "100% Pure Design" are partially visible.
