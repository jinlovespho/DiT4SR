[llava_13b]: The image is a close-up of a page with Chinese characters. The text is in a foreign language, and there is no English text visible.

[qwenvl_3b]: The image contains Chinese text, which translates to:"Image quality seriously deteriorated. Not suitable for use."This can be transcribed as:"The image quality has seriously deteriorated. It is not suitable for use."

[qwenvl_7b]: improvement of the CMOS processor, the image quality will be severely affected.

[llava_7b]: The image is a close-up of a piece of paper with Chinese writing on it. The paper appears to be a manual or a guide, possibly related to a computer or a software. The text is written in a mix of English and Chinese characters, making it difficult to decipher the content without knowing the specific language.

[llava_13b]: The image shows a page with a lot of Chinese writing. There is a small section of English text visible at the top left corner of the image. However, it is not possible to transcribe the English text without more information or a clearer view of the image.

[qwenvl_3b]: The CMOS quality is seriously deteriorated. Not to mention the 12-megapixel CMOS, it's even worse than that.

[qwenvl_7b]: improvement is not necessarily achieved by increasing the size, from which increased density of the pixels can be obtained. In the case of high-frequency performance, the pixel size is an important factor. Therefore, it is necessary to

[llava_7b]: The image is blurry, but it appears to be a foreign language text. The text is written in a combination of English and Chinese characters. The characters are scattered throughout the image, with some appearing more prominently than others. The text seems to be a mix of both languages, making it difficult to decipher the specific content.

[llava_13b]: The image is a blurry picture of a page with Chinese characters. However, there is a small section of English text visible in the bottom left corner of the image. The English text reads "CMS."

[qwenvl_3b]: The image contains some text in Chinese, which appears to be discussing the quality of an image and its components. The text mentions "CMOS" and "resolution," indicating that it is related to digital imaging technology. However, due to the blurriness, the exact meaning of the text is not entirely clear.

[qwenvl_7b]: The image contains Chinese text and some partially visible English words. The English words that can be seen include "CMOS" and "level." The Chinese text appears to discuss the quality of CMOS processors and their impact on image quality.
