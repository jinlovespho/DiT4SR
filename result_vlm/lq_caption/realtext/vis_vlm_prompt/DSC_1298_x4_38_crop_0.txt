[llava_7b]: The image displays a blurry chart with a number 9 prominently visible. The chart is likely related to a measurement or a scale, as it is described as a ruler. The presence of the number 9 suggests that it might be a reference point or a specific measurement on the chart.

[llava_13b]: The image is blurry, but it appears to be a ruler with numbers on it. The numbers are in a row, and the ruler is positioned horizontally. The numbers are likely to be in a sequence, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on. The ruler is used for measuring or comparing lengths, and the blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern the exact numbers.

[qwenvl_3b]: The image contains the following text: "8 9 10"

[qwenvl_7b]: The image shows a blurred view of what appears to be a ruler or measuring tool with numbers and lines. The numbers 8, 9, and 10 are clearly visible, along with some lines that might represent measurements. The text is not legible due to the blurriness.
