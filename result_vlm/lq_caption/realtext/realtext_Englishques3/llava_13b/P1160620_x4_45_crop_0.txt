The image shows a stadium with a sign on the wall. The sign is written in a foreign language, but the word "11" is visible in the image. The stadium is filled with green chairs, which are arranged in rows. The chairs are placed in various positions, some closer to the foreground and others further back in the scene. The overall atmosphere of the stadium appears to be empty, with no people visible in the image.
