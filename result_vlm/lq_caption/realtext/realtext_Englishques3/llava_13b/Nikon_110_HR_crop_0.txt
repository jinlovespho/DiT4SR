The image features a large white flower, possibly a fleur-de-lis, on a building. The flower is accompanied by a foreign language inscription, which is written in a different color. The inscription appears to be a combination of letters and numbers, but it is not possible to determine the exact meaning or content of the text due to the low quality of the image.
