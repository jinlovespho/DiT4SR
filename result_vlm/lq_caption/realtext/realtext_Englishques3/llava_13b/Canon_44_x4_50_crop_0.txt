The image features a painting of a man and a woman, with the woman holding a baby. The painting is surrounded by a circle of text, which appears to be in a foreign language. The woman is wearing a yellow dress, and the man is wearing a white shirt. The baby is positioned in the middle of the scene, with the woman holding it close to her chest.
