The image shows a ruler with a number line, indicating the measurements in inches. The ruler is placed next to a piece of fabric, possibly a shirt, which is being measured. The ruler has numbers from 8 to 10, with the number 8 being at the bottom and the number 10 at the top. The ruler is positioned horizontally, and the fabric is placed vertically, allowing for accurate measurements.
