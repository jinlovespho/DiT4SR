The image shows a close-up of an eye chart, which is a chart used to measure visual acuity. The chart consists of rows of letters, numbers, and symbols, with the letters getting smaller as they progress down the chart. The letters are arranged in a way that makes it difficult for people to read them, especially for those with poor vision. The chart is designed to help optometrists determine the visual acuity of a person by asking them to read the smallest line they can see clearly.
