The image features a ruler with a circle drawn on it. The ruler is placed next to the circle, and the circle is positioned at the center of the ruler. The ruler has a series of numbers on it, including 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The numbers are arranged in a linear fashion, with the numbers 1 and 2 on the left side, 3 and 4 in the middle, and 5 on the right side. The circle's position on the ruler indicates that it is at the center of the ruler, which is the point of intersection for the ruler's two halves.
