The image shows a stack of books with Asian writing on them. The books are arranged in a way that the top and bottom books are visible, while the middle book is obscured. The top book has the word "Pub" written on it, and the bottom book has the word "Pub" as well. The middle book is not clearly visible, but it is likely that it also has the word "Pub" on it.
