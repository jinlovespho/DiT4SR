The image features a wooden rack with several different colored ropes hanging on it. There are five ropes in total, with one being white, another being yellow, and the remaining three being green. The ropes are arranged in a row, with the white rope being the first one on the left side, followed by the yellow rope, and then the three green ropes on the right side. The wooden rack is placed against a wall, and the ropes are neatly organized, creating an orderly display.
