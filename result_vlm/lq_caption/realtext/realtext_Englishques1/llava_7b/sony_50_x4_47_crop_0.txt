The image is a close-up of a piece of paper with a black and white design. The paper appears to be a floor plan, possibly for a building or a room. The design on the paper consists of a combination of triangles and squares, with some of the triangles being black and the squares being white. The paper is folded in the middle, creating a crease that separates the two halves of the design.
