The image features a white board with a grid of black squares. There are two coins placed on the board, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The coins are positioned in the middle of the grid, with one coin closer to the top and the other closer to the bottom. The board appears to be a part of a game or a learning tool, as it is designed to help players or students understand the concept of numbers and their arrangement.
