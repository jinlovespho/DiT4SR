A letter is written on a piece of paper, which is placed on a black background. The letter is addressed to someone, and it appears to be a personal message. The writing is in a cursive style, which adds a personal touch to the letter. The paper is folded, and the writing is visible on both sides, indicating that it is a double-sided letter.
