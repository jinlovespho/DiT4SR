The image appears to be of a book or a set of books with Chinese characters on the spines. The text is not fully legible due to the resolution, but it seems to include some form of title or description that might be related to "法律" (law) and "刑法" (criminal law). However, without a clearer image, it's difficult to provide an accurate transcription.
