The image is blurry, but it appears to be a ruler with numbers and flags on it. The numbers are in the range of 1 to 12, and there are three flags on the ruler. The flags are positioned at different points along the ruler, with one flag near the top, another in the middle, and the third one near the bottom. The ruler is likely used for measuring or marking distances, with the flags serving as reference points or indicators.
