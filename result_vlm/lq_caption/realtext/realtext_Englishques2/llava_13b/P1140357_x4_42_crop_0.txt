The image is blurry, but it appears to be a close-up of a metal railing with a metal box attached to it. The metal box has a combination lock, which is a security feature commonly found on safes or storage units. The combination lock consists of multiple dials, each with a different number, which must be set to the correct sequence to unlock the box.
