The image is blurry, but it appears to be a sign with a combination of English text and Arabic characters. The English text reads "32" and "43," while the Arabic characters are located below the English text. The sign seems to be related to time or measurements, as the numbers and characters are arranged in a way that suggests a connection to these concepts.
