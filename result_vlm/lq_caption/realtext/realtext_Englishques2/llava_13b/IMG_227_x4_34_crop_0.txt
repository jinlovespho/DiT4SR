The image is blurry, but it appears to be a ruler with numbers on it. The ruler has a line running down the middle, and the numbers are labeled on both sides of the line. The numbers are in a sequence, starting from 8 and ending with 10. The ruler is placed next to a piece of fabric, possibly for measuring purposes.
