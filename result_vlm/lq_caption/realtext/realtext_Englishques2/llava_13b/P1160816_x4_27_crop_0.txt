The image is blurry, but it appears to be a ruler with numbers on it. The numbers are arranged in a line, with the first number being 5, followed by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The ruler is likely used for measuring or marking distances, and the blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern any other details.
