The image is blurry, but it appears to be a ruler with a line on it. The ruler is placed next to a black background, and the line on the ruler is labeled with the number "5." The ruler is likely used for measuring or marking distances, and the presence of the number "5" indicates that it is a standard ruler with measurements in increments of five.
