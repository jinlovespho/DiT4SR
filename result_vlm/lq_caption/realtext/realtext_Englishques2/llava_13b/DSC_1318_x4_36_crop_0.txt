The image is blurry, but it appears to be a graph or a chart with a vertical line and a horizontal line intersecting at a point. The vertical line has a number "1" written on it, while the horizontal line has a number "11" written on it. The intersection of these lines indicates a point of interest or a specific value in the chart.
