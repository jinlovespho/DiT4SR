The image is blurry, but it appears to be a barcode with the numbers 3, 5, and 4 visible. The barcode is made up of black and white stripes, and the numbers are arranged in a way that they can be read by a scanner. The blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern any other details or characters.
