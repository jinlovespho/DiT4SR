The image features a blurry sign with a mix of English and Chinese characters. The sign has a yellow, green, and pink color scheme, and it appears to be a list of items. The English text on the sign is "2010," which suggests that the image was taken in that year. The Chinese characters are written in a vertical format, and they are placed next to the English text. The sign is likely meant to convey information or instructions to the viewer, but the blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern the specific details.
