The image features a close-up of a black computer tower, with the brand name "OptiPlex 790" visible on the front. The computer tower is likely a part of a larger system, as there are two USB ports on the side of the tower. The blurry nature of the image suggests that it might have been taken from a distance or with a camera that is not focused properly.
