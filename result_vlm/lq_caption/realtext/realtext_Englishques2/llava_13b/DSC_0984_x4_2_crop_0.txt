The image is blurry, but it appears to be a color checker or a color chart. The color checker is designed to help users identify and match specific colors. The chart is displayed on a screen, and the colors are arranged in a grid-like pattern. The blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern the exact colors and their names, but it is clear that the image is meant to assist in color identification and matching.
