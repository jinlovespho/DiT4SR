The image is blurry, but it appears to be a graph or a chart with a ruler or a measuring stick. The ruler has numbers on it, indicating measurements or values. The numbers are spaced out along the ruler, with some numbers being closer to the top and others near the bottom. The ruler is likely used for measuring or comparing different values in the context of the graph or chart.
