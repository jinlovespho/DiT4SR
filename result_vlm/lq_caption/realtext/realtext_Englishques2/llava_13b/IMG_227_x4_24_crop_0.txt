The image is blurry, but it appears to be a ruler with numbers on it. The numbers are arranged in a vertical line, with the first number being 6 and the last number being 9. The ruler is likely used for measuring or marking distances, and the numbers are spaced out along the ruler to provide accurate measurements.
