The image shows a wooden shelf with several items hanging on it. There are three white items hanging from the shelf, and one of them has a pearl on it. The pearl is located in the middle of the hanging items, and it appears to be the focal point of the scene. The other items on the shelf are not clearly identifiable, but they seem to be part of the same display.
