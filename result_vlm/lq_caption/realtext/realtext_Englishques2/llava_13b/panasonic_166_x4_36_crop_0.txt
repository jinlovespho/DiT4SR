The image is blurry, but it appears to be a close-up of a ruler with numbers on it. The ruler has a black and white color scheme, and the numbers are arranged in a line. The numbers are spaced out, with some closer to the top and others near the bottom of the ruler. The ruler is likely used for measuring or marking distances, and the blurry nature of the image makes it difficult to discern the exact measurements or details.
