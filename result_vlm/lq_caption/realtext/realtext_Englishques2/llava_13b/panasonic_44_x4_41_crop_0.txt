The image features a yellow sign with a combination of English and Chinese characters. The English text on the sign reads "Window Cleaning." The sign also has a picture of a window cleaner, which is a person holding a squeegee. The presence of both English and Chinese characters suggests that the sign is intended for a diverse audience, possibly in a multicultural or tourist-heavy area.
