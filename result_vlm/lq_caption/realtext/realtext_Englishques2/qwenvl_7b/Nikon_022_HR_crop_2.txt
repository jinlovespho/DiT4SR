The image shows a calendar page for January 2019. The word "JANUARY" is written in all capital letters at the top left corner, and "2019" is written below it. There is also a large orange circle with the number "1" inside it, which likely indicates the first day of the month. The rest of the numbers and details are not clearly visible due to the blurriness of the image.
