The image shows a close-up of a computer screen with some text and icons. The text appears to be in a language other than English, but there is a small portion that looks like it might say "Windows" at the top left corner. Below that, there is some text that is not clearly legible due to the blurriness. There are also some icons, including what seems to be a Windows logo, which is partially visible.
