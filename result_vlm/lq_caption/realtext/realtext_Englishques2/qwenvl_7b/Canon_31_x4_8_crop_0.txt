The image appears to be a close-up of a label with some text on it. The text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness, but there seems to be a yellow section with black text and possibly a logo or design element above it. The text below the yellow section includes the word "SUGAR" in bold, followed by other words that are difficult to make out clearly. There might also be a number or code next to "SUGAR," but it's not legible.
