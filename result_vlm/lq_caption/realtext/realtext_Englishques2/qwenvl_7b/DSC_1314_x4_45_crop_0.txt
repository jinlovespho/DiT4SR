The image contains some text that appears to be in Chinese and possibly some numbers. Here's what is visible:- 商场固定资产标签 (This translates to "Shopping Mall Fixed Asset Label")- G104E1801174- 其他 (This means "Other" in English)- 中性尖劈板 (This likely refers to a type of board or panel, but it's not clear without more context)The text is somewhat blurry, making it difficult to read fully.
