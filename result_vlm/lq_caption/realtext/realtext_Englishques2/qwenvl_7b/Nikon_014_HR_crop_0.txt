The image contains Chinese characters and some blurred text that is not clearly legible. The visible Chinese characters appear to be "福" (fú), which means "blessing" or "good fortune," and "相" (xiāng), which can mean "together" or "to look at." There is also a heart symbol between these two characters. The rest of the text is too blurry to decipher.
