The image contains several Chinese characters and some English words that appear to be part of a larger text or sign. The visible characters include "示研" (shì yán), which could be part of a longer phrase or title. There is also a small English word "of" and what looks like the beginning of another word that might be "the" or something similar. The rest of the text is too blurry to decipher clearly.
