The image appears to be a close-up of a business card or some kind of document with a logo and some text. The text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness, but there seems to be an "E" followed by some numbers and possibly a date format (e.g., "01/20"). There's also a small symbol that looks like a stylized "C" inside a circle.
