The image shows a storefront with some visible signage. The most prominent text appears to be "Bakery" in red letters, which is partially obscured by what seems to be a person's arm. There is also a sign that includes the word "Bakery" again, but it is less clear due to the blurriness and angle. The rest of the text on the signs is not legible.
