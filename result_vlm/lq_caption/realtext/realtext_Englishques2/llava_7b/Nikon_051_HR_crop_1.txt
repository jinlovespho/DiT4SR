The image features a blurry sign with a mix of English and Chinese characters. The English text includes the words "2010" and "2011," indicating the years the sign is referring to. The Chinese characters are scattered throughout the sign, but they are not clearly distinguishable. The sign appears to be a combination of both languages, possibly representing a bilingual event or location.
