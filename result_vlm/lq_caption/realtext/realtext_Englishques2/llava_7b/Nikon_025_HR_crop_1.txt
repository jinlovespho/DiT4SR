The image features a chalkboard with a calendar displayed on it. The calendar is divided into two sections, one for the days of the week and the other for the months of the year. The days of the week are labeled with numbers from 1 to 31, while the months are labeled with letters from A to M. The chalkboard is placed on a wooden surface, and the writing appears to be in a foreign language.
