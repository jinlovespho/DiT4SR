The image is blurry, but it appears to be a sign with a green walking figure and the word "exit" written in white. The sign is likely located in a foreign country, as indicated by the presence of Chinese characters. The walking figure is a common symbol for pedestrian crossings or exits, and the word "exit" is written below it.
