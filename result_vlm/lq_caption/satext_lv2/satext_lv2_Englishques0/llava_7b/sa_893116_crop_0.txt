The image shows a large building with a sign that reads "Port Authority." The building is situated near a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. There are two people in the scene, one standing closer to the left side of the image and the other person standing further to the right. The presence of the sign and the people suggest that this location might be a busy transportation hub or a popular tourist destination.
