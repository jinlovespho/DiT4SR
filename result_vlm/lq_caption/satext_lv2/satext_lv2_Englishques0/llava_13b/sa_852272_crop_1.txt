The image features a small boat docked in a canal next to a red brick building. The boat is blue and white, and it is tied to the dock. The boat is positioned in front of a doorway, which is located on the left side of the building. The scene appears to be in a foreign country, possibly Italy, as the boat is described as a gondola.
