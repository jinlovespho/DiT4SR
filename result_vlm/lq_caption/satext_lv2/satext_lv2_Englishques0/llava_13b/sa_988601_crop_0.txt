The image features a building with a blue awning that reads "Kings Arcade Unique Specialty Shops." The building is made of red bricks and has a window on the top floor. There are several people in the scene, with one person standing near the left side of the building, another person closer to the center, and a third person on the right side.

In addition to the people, there are two cars parked in the scene, one on the left side and another on the right side of the building. The presence of the cars and people suggests that this location is a busy area with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
