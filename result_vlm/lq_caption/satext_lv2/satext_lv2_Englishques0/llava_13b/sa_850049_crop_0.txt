The image features a bicycle parked on a brick sidewalk. The bicycle has a green box attached to it, which is likely a parking meter. The parking meter is placed on the bicycle's handlebars, making it convenient for the owner to pay for their parking spot. The brick sidewalk provides a stable surface for the bicycle to be parked on, and the green box on the handlebars adds a touch of color to the scene.
