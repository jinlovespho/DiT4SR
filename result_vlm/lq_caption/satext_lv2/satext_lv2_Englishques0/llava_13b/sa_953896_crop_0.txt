The image features a large airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane has a red and blue tail, which is the logo of Delta Airlines. The airplane is surrounded by several vehicles, including trucks and cars, which are likely servicing the aircraft.

There are also a few people in the scene, possibly airport staff or passengers. One person is standing near the left side of the airplane, while two others are located closer to the right side. The presence of these vehicles and people indicates that the airplane is being prepared for its next flight.
