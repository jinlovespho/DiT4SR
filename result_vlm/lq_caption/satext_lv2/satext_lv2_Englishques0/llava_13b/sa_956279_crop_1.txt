The image features a display of makeup products in a store. There are several bottles of makeup, including a bottle of lipstick, placed on a counter. The display also includes a mirror, which is likely used for customers to try on the makeup.

In addition to the makeup products, there are a few books scattered around the display. Some books are placed near the lipstick, while others are located closer to the edge of the counter. The presence of these books suggests that the store may also sell other items, such as books or magazines, in addition to makeup products.
