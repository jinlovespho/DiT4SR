The image features a large body of water with a city skyline in the background. The skyline is dominated by a tall green building, which stands out among the other buildings. There are several boats on the water, including a small boat near the center of the scene and a larger boat further to the right.

In addition to the boats, there are a few people scattered around the water, possibly enjoying the view or engaging in water activities. The overall atmosphere of the scene is serene and picturesque, with the city skyline providing a striking contrast to the calm water and the surrounding greenery.
