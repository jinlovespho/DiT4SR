The image features a restaurant with several tables and chairs set up outside. The tables are covered with white umbrellas, and the chairs are arranged around them. The umbrellas have the word "Tyskie" written on them, which is a Polish restaurant.

There are multiple dining tables in the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further back. The chairs are placed around these tables, creating a comfortable outdoor dining area. The arrangement of the tables and chairs, along with the umbrellas, creates a welcoming atmosphere for guests to enjoy their meals.
