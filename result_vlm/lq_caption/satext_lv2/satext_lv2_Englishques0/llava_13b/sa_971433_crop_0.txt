The image features a harbor with several boats docked in the water. There are at least six boats visible, with some of them being larger and others smaller. The boats are scattered throughout the harbor, with some closer to the shore and others further out in the water.

In addition to the boats, there are a few people present in the scene. One person is standing near the left side of the harbor, while another person is located closer to the center. A third person can be seen on the right side of the harbor. The presence of people suggests that they might be boat owners or visitors enjoying the view of the harbor.
