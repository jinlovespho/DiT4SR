The image features a canal with a building on one side and a dock on the other. There are several boats in the water, including a gondola. The gondola is docked next to a building, and there are two other boats visible in the scene.

In addition to the boats, there are a few people present in the image. One person is standing near the gondola, while two others are located closer to the building. The scene appears to be a picturesque waterfront location, possibly in Venice, Italy.
