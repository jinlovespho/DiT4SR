The image features a jockey riding a horse on a track. The jockey is wearing a green shirt and a green helmet. The horse is positioned near a fence, and the jockey is holding the reins tightly.

There are several other people in the scene, some of them standing near the fence, while others are scattered around the track. The presence of multiple people suggests that this could be a race or a training session.
