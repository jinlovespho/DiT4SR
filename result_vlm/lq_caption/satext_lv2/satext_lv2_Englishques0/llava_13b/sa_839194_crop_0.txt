The image features a large boat docked at a pier. The boat is situated in the middle of the scene, with a bridge in the background. There are several people on the boat, enjoying their time on the water.

In addition to the boat, there are two traffic lights visible in the scene, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The presence of these traffic lights suggests that the boat is docked in a busy area with vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
