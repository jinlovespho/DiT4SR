The image features a city street with a row of parked cars in front of a building. There are several cars parked along the street, including a silver car and a black car. A parking meter is visible on the sidewalk, indicating that the cars are parked in a designated area.

In addition to the cars, there are two potted plants on the sidewalk, one near the center of the scene and the other towards the right side. A person can be seen standing near the center of the scene, possibly attending to one of the parked cars or just passing by.
