The image shows a street with several cars parked on both sides. There are at least 13 cars visible in the scene, with some parked closer to the foreground and others further back. A person can be seen standing near the center of the scene, possibly walking or observing the parked cars.

In the middle of the street, there is a large "X" painted on the road, which might indicate a specific parking zone or a temporary restriction. The presence of multiple cars parked on both sides of the street suggests that this is a busy area with a high demand for parking spaces.
