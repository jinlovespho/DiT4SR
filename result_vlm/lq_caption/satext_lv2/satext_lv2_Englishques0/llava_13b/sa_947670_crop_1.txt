The image features a large blue and white airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane is positioned next to a bus, which is likely used for transporting passengers to and from the airport. There are several people in the scene, some of them standing near the airplane, while others are scattered around the tarmac. The presence of the bus and people suggests that the airplane is either preparing for departure or has recently arrived, and passengers are either boarding or disembarking.
