The image features a brick building with a sign on it that reads "Texas." There are three scooters parked in front of the building, with one scooter closer to the left side, another in the middle, and the third one on the right side. The scooters are lined up, and they appear to be locked to a railing. The scene suggests that the scooters are being used as a convenient mode of transportation for people in the area.
