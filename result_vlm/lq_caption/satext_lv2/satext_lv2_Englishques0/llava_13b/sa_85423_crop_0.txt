The image features a man standing in front of a building with a blue awning. The awning has the word "Mayor" written on it. The man appears to be looking at the awning, possibly admiring the design or considering the message it conveys.

There are also two other people in the scene, one standing to the left of the man and the other to the right. Additionally, there is a backpack placed on the ground near the right side of the image.
