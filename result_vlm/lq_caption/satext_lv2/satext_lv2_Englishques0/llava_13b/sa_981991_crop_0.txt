The image features a large white boat floating on a body of water near a building. The boat is positioned in front of the building, which appears to be a brick structure. The boat is quite large, occupying a significant portion of the water.

In addition to the main boat, there is a smaller boat visible in the scene, located towards the left side of the image. The presence of these boats suggests that the area might be a harbor or a popular spot for boating activities.
