The image shows a close-up of a silver electrical box with a few visible English characters. There are two numbers, 15 and 18, and a single letter, "C," on the box. The box appears to be a part of a larger electrical system, and the presence of these characters suggests that it might be related to the electrical system's configuration or settings.
