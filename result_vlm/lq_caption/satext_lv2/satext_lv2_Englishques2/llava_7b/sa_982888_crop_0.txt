The image features a space shuttle on display in a museum. The shuttle is positioned in the center of the scene, surrounded by various other objects. There are two people in the image, one standing closer to the left side and the other near the right side.

In addition to the space shuttle, there are two other objects in the scene. One is a bowl, located near the center-right of the image, and the other is a cup, situated on the left side. The presence of these objects suggests that the museum may also house other exhibits related to space exploration or technology.
