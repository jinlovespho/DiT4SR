The image appears to be a close-up of a stone plaque with some text engraved on it. The text is partially obscured and blurry, making it difficult to read fully. However, there seems to be a line that starts with "In memory of" followed by what looks like a name. Below that, there might be another line starting with "Passed away on," but the rest of the text is not clear due to the blurriness.
