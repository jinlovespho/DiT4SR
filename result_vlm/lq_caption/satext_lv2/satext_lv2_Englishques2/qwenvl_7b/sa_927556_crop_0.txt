The image contains some blurry text that appears to be in Chinese and possibly some English. The visible text includes "大屯路" which is likely a street name, and "PROVIDE DE METRO" which could be part of a sign indicating a metro station or related to public transportation. The rest of the text is not clear due to the blurriness.
