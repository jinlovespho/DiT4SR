The image shows a bottle with the word "Mike's" prominently displayed in a stylized font at the top. Below that, there is additional text that appears to say "Blood Orange," though it is somewhat blurred and not entirely clear. The background of the label is dark, possibly black, which contrasts with the lighter text.
