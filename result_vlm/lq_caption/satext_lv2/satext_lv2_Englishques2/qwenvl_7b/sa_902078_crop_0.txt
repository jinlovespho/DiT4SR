The image shows a blurry view of a storefront with some visible text. The most prominent word is "ANTOR" in large letters, which appears to be part of a larger sign or name. Below it, there's a smaller sign that includes the words "BRU" and "DER," but the rest of the text is not clearly legible due to the blurriness.
