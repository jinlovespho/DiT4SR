The image shows a storefront with some English text visible. The most prominent text reads "TOKYO" in large letters above the entrance. Below that, there is smaller text that appears to say "SUSHI" and "BAR." There are also some other signs with Japanese characters, but they are not clearly legible due to the blurriness of the image.
