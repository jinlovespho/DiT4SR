The image shows part of an aircraft engine with some visible text and characters. The text appears to be "CFM" which is likely part of the CFM International logo, indicating that the engine is made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. There are also some smaller characters below "CFM" but they are not clearly legible in the image.
