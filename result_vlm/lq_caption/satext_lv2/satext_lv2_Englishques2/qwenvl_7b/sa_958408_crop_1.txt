The image shows a close-up of a pair of black and red shoes with some white text on them. The text appears to be "F" and "R," which might stand for "Front" and "Rear," possibly indicating the directionality of the shoes. There is also a small yellow logo near the "F" that looks like a stylized "F" inside a circle.
