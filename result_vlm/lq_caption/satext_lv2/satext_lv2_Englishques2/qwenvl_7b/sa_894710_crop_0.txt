The image shows a sign with the number "3" at the top left corner and some text below it that appears to be in a different language, possibly Cyrillic script. The text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness, but it seems to include the word "Kontakt" which means "contact" in German. There is also a date "07.2019" visible, suggesting a year.
