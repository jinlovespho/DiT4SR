The image is blurry, but it appears to be a display window of a store showcasing clothing items. The store is named "Gucci." There are several pairs of shoes visible in the display, with one pair located near the left side of the window and another pair towards the right side. The shoes are placed on a shelf, and the store's name is written on the window.
