The image features a red airplane parked on a runway. The airplane is positioned in the middle of the scene, with its wings spread out. There are two small cones placed on the ground, one near the left side of the airplane and the other closer to the right side. The presence of these cones suggests that the airplane is being prepared for takeoff or has recently landed.
