The image features a restaurant with several tables and chairs under white umbrellas. The umbrellas have the word "Tyskie" written on them, which is a Polish word. The tables are arranged in rows, and there are multiple chairs placed around them. Some of the chairs are empty, while others have orange jackets draped over them.

In addition to the tables and chairs, there are a few cups and bottles scattered around the scene, possibly indicating that the restaurant is in use or has recently been used.
