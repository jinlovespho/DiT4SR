The image is a blurry view of a city street with a row of potted plants lining the sidewalk. There are three potted plants visible in the scene, with one located near the left side, another in the middle, and the third one on the right side of the sidewalk.

In addition to the potted plants, there is a person standing near the right side of the image, possibly enjoying the cityscape or waiting for someone. The street appears to be a lively urban environment with various elements contributing to the overall atmosphere.
