The image is a blurry view of a city street with tall buildings. There are two American flags visible in the scene, one on the left side and the other on the right side. Additionally, there is a sign with the word "NYC" on it, which stands for New York City. The presence of these flags and the NYC sign suggests that the image was taken in the United States, possibly in New York City.
