The image shows a city street with a row of parked cars. There are five cars in total, with one car parked closer to the left side of the street, another car parked in the middle, and three cars parked on the right side.

In addition to the cars, there are two potted plants visible in the scene, one located near the center of the image and the other towards the right side. A person can also be seen standing near the center of the image, possibly attending to one of the parked cars or just passing by.
