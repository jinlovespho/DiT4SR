The image shows a black car driving down a street next to a building. There are several other cars parked along the street, including one on the left side of the street and another on the right side. A stop sign is visible on the left side of the street, and a traffic light is present further down the road.

There are also a few people in the scene, with one person standing near the center of the image, another person on the right side, and a third person closer to the right edge of the image. The presence of these people and the cars suggests that this is a busy street in a city.
