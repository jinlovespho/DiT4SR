The image shows a city street with tall buildings on both sides. The buildings are made of brick and have many windows. There are two American flags hanging from the buildings, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The flags are flying in the wind, adding a sense of patriotism to the scene. The street appears to be located in New York City, as indicated by the presence of the flags.
