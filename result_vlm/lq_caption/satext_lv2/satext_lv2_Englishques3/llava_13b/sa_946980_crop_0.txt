The image features a harbor with several boats docked in the water. There are at least four boats visible in the scene, with one boat being larger and occupying a significant portion of the image. The other boats are smaller and can be seen in the background.

In addition to the boats, there are two people present in the scene, one near the center and the other towards the right side. The harbor appears to be a popular spot for boating and leisure activities.
