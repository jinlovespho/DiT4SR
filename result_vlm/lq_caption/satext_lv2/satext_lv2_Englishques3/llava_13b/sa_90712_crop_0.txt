The image shows a pool with a blue tarp covering it. There are two benches in the scene, one on the left side and another on the right side of the pool. The benches are placed at different angles, with one being more vertical and the other more horizontal. The pool appears to be empty, and the tarp is covering the water, possibly for maintenance or safety purposes.
