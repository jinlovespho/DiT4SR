A yellow boat with a canopy is floating on a river. There are four people on the boat, enjoying their time together. The boat is surrounded by a park-like setting, with trees and benches nearby. Some people are standing on the benches, possibly watching the boat or enjoying the view. There are also a few umbrellas in the scene, providing shade for the people in the park.
