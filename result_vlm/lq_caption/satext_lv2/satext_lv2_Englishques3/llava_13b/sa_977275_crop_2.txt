The image shows a blue rope tied to a metal pipe. The rope is hanging from the pipe, which is located near a window. The pipe appears to be a part of a water system, possibly a water hose or a pipe for a water fountain. The rope is tied to the pipe, ensuring it stays in place and does not get disconnected.
