The image shows a group of people sitting on a cement fountain in a city. There are at least five people visible in the scene, with some sitting closer to the fountain and others further away. A man is standing near the fountain, possibly observing the group or waiting for his turn to join them.

The setting appears to be a public space, possibly a park or a plaza, with a building in the background. The people seem to be enjoying their time together, creating a lively atmosphere in the city.
