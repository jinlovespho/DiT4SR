The image features a large brick building with a red awning, likely a restaurant or store. The building has a prominent clock on its side, making it easy for passersby to tell the time. There are several people walking around the area, some of them carrying handbags.

In the scene, a car is parked on the left side of the building, and a bus is visible on the right side. The presence of these vehicles suggests that the area is a busy urban location.
