The image depicts a group of people sitting on a cement fountain in a city square. There are at least five people visible in the scene, with some sitting closer to the fountain and others further away. 

A man is standing near the fountain, possibly observing the group or waiting for his turn to join them. There are also two handbags in the scene, one placed near the center of the image and the other closer to the right side. The overall atmosphere appears to be relaxed and social, as people gather around the fountain to enjoy their time in the city square.
