The image features a street with a building that has a white awning. The awning is attached to a building with a balcony. There are two potted plants visible in the scene, one located near the left side of the image and the other closer to the center.

In addition to the building with the white awning, there are two umbrellas in the scene. One umbrella is located on the right side of the image, while the other is situated in the middle. The presence of these umbrellas suggests that the image might have been taken during a rainy day or in a location where outdoor seating is common.
