The image features a purple sign with a woman riding a bicycle on it. The sign is placed on a pole, and it appears to be a sign for a women's bike ride. The sign is surrounded by various potted plants, with one plant located on the left side, another on the right side, and a third one in the background. The scene seems to be set in a garden or an outdoor area with a focus on the sign and the plants.
