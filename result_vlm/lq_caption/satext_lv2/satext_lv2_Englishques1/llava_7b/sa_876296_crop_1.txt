The image features a group of scooters parked in a row on a sidewalk. There are five scooters in total, with one on the left side, two in the middle, and two on the right side of the image. The scooters are parked in front of a building, possibly a school, as there is a basketball hoop nearby. The scene suggests that the scooters belong to students or visitors of the school.
