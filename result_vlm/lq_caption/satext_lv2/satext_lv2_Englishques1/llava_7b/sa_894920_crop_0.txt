The image features a city street with a row of parked cars. There are several cars parked on the side of the street, with some closer to the foreground and others further back. A few cars are parked in front of a building, which appears to be a church.

In addition to the cars, there are two potted plants visible in the scene. One is located near the center of the image, while the other is situated closer to the right side. The presence of these plants adds a touch of greenery to the urban environment.
