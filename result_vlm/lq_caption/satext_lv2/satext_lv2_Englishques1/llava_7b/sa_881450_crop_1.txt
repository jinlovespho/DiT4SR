The image features a large building with a clock tower on top. The building has a sign on it that reads "Quarter Leagues." There are several people in the scene, with one person riding a bicycle in front of the building. Another person is standing near the bicycle, and a third person is located further away from the bicycle. The presence of these individuals suggests that the building might be a popular spot for people to gather or pass by.
