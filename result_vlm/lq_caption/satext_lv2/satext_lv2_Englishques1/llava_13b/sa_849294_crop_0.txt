The image features a street scene with a no motor vehicle cruising sign prominently displayed. The sign is positioned on a pole, and it is located near a pedestrian crossing sign. There are also several traffic lights in the scene, with one on the left side, one in the middle, and another on the right side.

In addition to the traffic signs, there are two people visible in the image. One person is standing near the left side of the scene, while the other person is located closer to the center. The presence of these individuals suggests that the area is active and possibly a busy street.
