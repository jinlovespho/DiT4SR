The image features a large building with a clock mounted on its side. The clock is positioned near the top center of the building, and it appears to be a prominent feature. The building also has a green traffic light, which is located near the bottom left corner of the image. The combination of the clock and the traffic light suggests that this building might be a train station or a transportation hub.
