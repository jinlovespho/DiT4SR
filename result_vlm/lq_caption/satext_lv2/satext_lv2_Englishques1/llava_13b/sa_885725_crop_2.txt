The image features a red airplane parked on a runway. The airplane is positioned in the middle of the scene, with its wings spread out. There are two small cones placed on the ground, one near the left side of the airplane and the other towards the right side. The airplane's presence and the cones suggest that it might be undergoing maintenance or preparing for takeoff.
