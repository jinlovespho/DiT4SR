The image features a building with a large clock on its side. The clock is positioned above a doorway, and it appears to be an ornate and decorative piece. The building also has a statue of a man and a woman, adding to its architectural charm.

In addition to the clock and statues, there are several books visible in the scene. Some books are placed on the left side of the image, while others are scattered throughout the scene. The presence of these books suggests that the building might be a library or a place where people gather to read and study.
