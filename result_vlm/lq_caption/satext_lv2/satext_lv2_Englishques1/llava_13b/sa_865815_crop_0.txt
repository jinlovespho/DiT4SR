The image shows a street scene with a white sign on a pole. The sign is written in a foreign language, making it difficult to understand. There are also two traffic lights in the scene, one located near the top left corner and the other near the top right corner.

In the background, there are two cars parked on the street, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The cars are positioned at different distances from the camera, with the one on the left closer to the foreground and the one on the right further away.
