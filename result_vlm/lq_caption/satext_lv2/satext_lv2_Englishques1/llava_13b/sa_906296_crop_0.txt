The image features a beach scene with several wooden huts or shacks lined up on the sand. These huts are made of wood and have blue and white striped roofs, giving them a charming appearance. They are arranged in a row, with some huts closer to the foreground and others further back.

In addition to the huts, there are a few boats visible in the background, adding to the beach atmosphere. The boats are scattered around the scene, with some closer to the huts and others further away. The overall scene gives off a relaxing and inviting vibe, perfect for a day at the beach.
