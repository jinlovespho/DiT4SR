The image features a large boat docked at a pier, surrounded by a cityscape. The boat is situated in the middle of the scene, with a bridge visible in the background. There are several people scattered around the pier, some closer to the boat and others further away.

In addition to the boat, there are two cars parked nearby, one on the left side of the scene and the other on the right side. The presence of the cars and people suggests that this area is a popular spot for both boating and land-based activities.
