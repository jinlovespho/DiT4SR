The image features a harbor with several boats docked in the water. There are at least six boats visible in the scene, with some of them being larger and others smaller. The boats are scattered throughout the harbor, with some closer to the foreground and others further away.

In addition to the boats, there are a few people present in the scene. One person is standing near the left side of the image, while another person is located closer to the center. A third person can be seen on the right side of the image. The presence of people and boats creates a lively atmosphere in the harbor.
