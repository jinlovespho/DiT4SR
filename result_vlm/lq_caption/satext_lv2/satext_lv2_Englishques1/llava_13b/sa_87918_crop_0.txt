The image features a large boat docked at a pier. The boat is made of wood and has a white cabin. It is tied to the dock with a rope, ensuring it remains securely in place. The boat is surrounded by water, and there are a few other boats visible in the scene.

In addition to the boats, there are several people scattered around the area, possibly enjoying the view or attending to their boats. Some of them are closer to the foreground, while others are further away, near the edge of the image.
