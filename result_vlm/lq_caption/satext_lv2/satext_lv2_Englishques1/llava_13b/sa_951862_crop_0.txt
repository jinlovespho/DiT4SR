The image features a large gray boat, possibly a battleship or a cruiser, floating on the water. The boat has the number 154 written on its side, indicating its identification number. There are several people on the boat, with some standing closer to the front and others scattered around the middle and rear sections. The scene captures the boat's presence in the water, with the people on board possibly attending to their duties or enjoying their time on the vessel.
