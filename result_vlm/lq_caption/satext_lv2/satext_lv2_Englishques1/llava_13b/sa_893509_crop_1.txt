The image features a room with a tall, narrow wooden cabinet mounted on the wall. The cabinet has a shelf inside, which is filled with several books. The books are arranged in a row, with some books placed horizontally and others vertically. The cabinet appears to be a part of a larger structure, possibly a church or a building with a historical or traditional design.
