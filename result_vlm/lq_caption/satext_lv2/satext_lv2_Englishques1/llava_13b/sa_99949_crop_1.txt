The image features a picturesque scene of a canal with a bridge crossing over it. The bridge is illuminated by lights, creating a beautiful atmosphere. On the other side of the canal, there are buildings, including a tall yellow building and a red building.

Several people can be seen in the scene, some of them standing near the buildings, while others are closer to the water. There are also multiple umbrellas scattered throughout the area, providing shade for the people.

In addition to the people and umbrellas, there are a few chairs and dining tables placed around the area, suggesting that this might be a popular spot for outdoor dining or relaxation.
