The image features a small boat floating on a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The boat is positioned in front of a building, which appears to be old and possibly abandoned. There are two people visible in the scene, one near the left side of the boat and the other closer to the right side. The boat seems to be moving, creating a sense of motion in the water.
