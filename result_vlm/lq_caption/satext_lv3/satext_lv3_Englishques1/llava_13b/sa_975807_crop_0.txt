The image features a street with a row of potted plants lining the sidewalks. There are at least five potted plants visible, with some of them placed closer to the foreground and others further back. The plants are of various sizes and are arranged in a neat line.

In the background, there is a building with a large sign on it, which is partially visible. The sign appears to be advertising a store or a business. The overall scene gives a sense of a well-maintained urban environment with greenery and commercial establishments.
