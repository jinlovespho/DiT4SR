The image features a large boat docked at a pier. The boat is situated in the middle of the scene, with a bridge visible in the background. There are several people scattered around the area, some closer to the boat and others further away.

In addition to the boat and people, there are two potted plants in the scene, one located near the left side of the image and the other closer to the right side. The presence of these plants adds a touch of greenery to the scene.
