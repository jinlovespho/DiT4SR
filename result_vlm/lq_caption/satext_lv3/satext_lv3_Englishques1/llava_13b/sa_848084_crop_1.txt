The image shows a close-up of a knife with a black handle, which is attached to a white handle. The knife is positioned in a way that it appears to be a part of a larger object, possibly a piece of machinery or a tool. The knife's blade is visible, and the handle is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the object.
