The image shows a red airplane parked on the tarmac, with its nose facing downwards. The airplane is positioned on the runway, and it appears to be a small jet. There are two cones visible in the scene, one located near the left side of the airplane and the other closer to the right side. The presence of these cones suggests that the airplane might be undergoing maintenance or inspection.
