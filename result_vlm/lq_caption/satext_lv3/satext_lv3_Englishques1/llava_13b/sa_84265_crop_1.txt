The image features a yellow and blue bus parked next to a brick wall. The bus is situated near a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. There are several people in the scene, with some standing close to the bus and others scattered around the area.

In addition to the bus, there are two cars parked nearby, one on the left side of the bus and the other on the right side. The presence of the brick wall and the water body create a picturesque setting for the bus and its passengers.
