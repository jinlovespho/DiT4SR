The image features a woman in a yellow shirt standing on a surfboard in the water, holding a sail. She appears to be windsurfing or preparing to windsurf. There are other people in the scene, some of them closer to the water's edge, and others further away.

In the background, there are a few cars parked, and a boat can be seen floating on the water. The scene seems to be taking place near a beach or a waterfront area.
