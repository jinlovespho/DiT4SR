The image features a large white building with a red roof. The building has a sign on it, which reads "Wiener." There are several windows on the building, some of which are open.

In the foreground, there are two red flags hanging from a pole. The flags are positioned at different heights, with one being higher than the other. The scene appears to be a combination of a house and a restaurant, as the building has a sign that reads "Wiener" and the presence of the flags suggests a festive or celebratory atmosphere.
