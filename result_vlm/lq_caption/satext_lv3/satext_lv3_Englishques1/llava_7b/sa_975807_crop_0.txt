The image is a black and white photo of a city street with a row of potted plants lining the sidewalk. There are five potted plants in total, with one on the left side, two in the middle, and two on the right side of the street. The street appears to be a commercial area, as there is a large sign visible in the background. The overall atmosphere of the image is nostalgic and captures the essence of a city street from a bygone era.
