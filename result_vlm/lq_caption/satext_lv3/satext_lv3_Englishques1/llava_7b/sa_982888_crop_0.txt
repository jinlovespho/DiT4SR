The image features a space shuttle on display in a museum. The shuttle is positioned in the center of the scene, with a large umbrella placed above it. The umbrella is open, providing shade and protection for the space shuttle.

In addition to the space shuttle and umbrella, there are several potted plants scattered throughout the scene. Some of these plants are placed near the shuttle, while others are located in the background. The presence of these plants adds a touch of greenery and life to the exhibit.
