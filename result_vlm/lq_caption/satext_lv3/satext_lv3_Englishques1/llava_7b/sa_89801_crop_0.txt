The image features a building with a large archway and a cross on top. The archway is adorned with a blue and white flag, and there are several birds flying around the area. The birds are scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the top of the archway and others flying near the cross. The combination of the building's architecture, the flag, and the birds creates a visually interesting scene.
