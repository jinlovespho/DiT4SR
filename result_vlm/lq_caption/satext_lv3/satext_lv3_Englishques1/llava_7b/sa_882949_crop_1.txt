The image features a vintage car driving down a street. The car is the main focus of the scene, and it appears to be an old-fashioned vehicle. There are several people in the background, some of them standing closer to the car, while others are further away.

In addition to the car and people, there are two bicycles in the scene. One bicycle is located near the left side of the image, while the other is positioned more towards the center. The presence of these bicycles suggests that the street might be a popular area for both pedestrians and cyclists.
