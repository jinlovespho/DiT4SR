The image features a large boat docked at a pier. The boat is situated in the middle of the scene, with a bridge visible in the background. The pier extends out into the water, providing a scenic view of the surrounding area.

There are several people scattered throughout the scene, likely enjoying the view or attending to the boat. Some of them are closer to the boat, while others are further away, near the edge of the pier. The presence of these individuals adds a sense of activity and life to the otherwise serene waterfront setting.
