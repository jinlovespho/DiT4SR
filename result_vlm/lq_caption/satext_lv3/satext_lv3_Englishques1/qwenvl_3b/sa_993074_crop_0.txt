It has multiple levels, with the top level featuring numerous windows and balconies, suggesting it is designed for accommodation. The lower levels seem to have more functional spaces, possibly including dining areas, lounges, or other amenities. The surrounding water is calm, and the sky is clear, indicating good weather conditions.
