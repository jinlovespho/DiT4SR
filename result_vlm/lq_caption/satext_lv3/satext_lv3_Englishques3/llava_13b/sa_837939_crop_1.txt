The image shows a room with a wooden floor and a white wall. There are four objects in the room, which appear to be cans or containers. The objects are placed in different positions, with one on the left side, one in the center, one on the right side, and one at the far end of the room. The objects are not clearly visible, but they are present in the scene.
