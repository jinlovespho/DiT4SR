The image features a city with a canal running through it. There are several buildings lining the canal, including a tall building on the left side and another on the right side. A bridge can be seen in the middle of the scene, connecting the buildings.

In addition to the buildings, there are two boats visible in the water. One boat is located near the left side of the image, while the other is situated closer to the right side. The scene appears to be captured at night, with the buildings and boats illuminated by artificial lighting.
