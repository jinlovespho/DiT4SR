The image shows a vintage car driving down a street. The car is an old-fashioned model, possibly a race car, and it is the center stage in the scene. There are several people around the car, some standing closer to the front and others further back.

In addition to the people, there are two bicycles in the scene, one located near the left side of the car and the other on the right side. The presence of the bicycles and the people suggests that this might be a special event or gathering involving the vintage car.
