The image is a blurry view of a city street with a car parked in front of a building. The car is positioned on the left side of the scene, and the building appears to be a store. There are several people walking around the area, with one person closer to the center of the scene and two others further to the right.

In addition to the people and the car, there are two handbags visible in the scene. One handbag is located near the center of the image, while the other is closer to the right side. The presence of these handbags suggests that the people in the scene might be shopping or running errands in the city.
