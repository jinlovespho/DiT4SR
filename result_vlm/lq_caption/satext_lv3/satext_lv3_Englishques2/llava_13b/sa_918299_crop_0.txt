The image features a large airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane is positioned in the middle of the scene, with its wings spread out. There are two people visible in the image, one standing near the left side of the airplane and the other person closer to the right side.

In addition to the airplane and people, there are two traffic lights in the scene. One traffic light is located near the top right corner of the image, while the other is situated in the middle-right area. The presence of these traffic lights suggests that the airport has a well-organized traffic control system to ensure the safe movement of aircraft and ground vehicles.
