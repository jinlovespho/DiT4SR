The image features a boat floating on a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The boat is large and appears to be a ferry or a barge. There are several people on the boat, with some standing closer to the front and others scattered around the middle and rear sections.

In addition to the people, there are two benches visible on the boat, one located near the center and the other towards the rear. The presence of benches suggests that the boat may be used for transportation or leisure activities.
