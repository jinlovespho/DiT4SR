The image shows a large airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. The airplane is positioned in the middle of the scene, with its tail visible. There are several other airplanes in the background, both in the foreground and background.

In addition to the airplanes, there are two trucks present in the scene. One truck is located near the left side of the image, while the other truck is situated closer to the right side. The presence of these vehicles suggests that the airport is actively preparing for takeoff or has recently landed.
