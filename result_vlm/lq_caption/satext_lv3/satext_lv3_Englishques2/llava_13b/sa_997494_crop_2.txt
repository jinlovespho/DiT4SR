The image is a blurry photo of a building with a row of arched windows. The building appears to be made of stone, and the windows are located on the second floor. The windows are spaced out, with some closer to the left side of the building and others towards the right side. The blurry nature of the photo makes it difficult to discern any specific details or text on the building.
