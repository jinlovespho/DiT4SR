The image is a blurry view of a bridge over a body of water, with a building in the background. The bridge appears to be a part of a cityscape, and there is a train passing over it. The train is located in the middle of the scene, with the bridge stretching across the water. The overall scene is quite busy, with the train and the bridge being the main focal points.
