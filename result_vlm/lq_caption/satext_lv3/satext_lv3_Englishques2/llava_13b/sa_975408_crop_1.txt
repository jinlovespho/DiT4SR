The image features a close-up of a red carriage wheel with a yellow tag on it. The tag has the word "Buckingham" written on it. The wheel is part of a red carriage, and the tag is attached to the spokes of the wheel. The scene appears to be set on a brick road, giving a sense of history and charm to the image.
