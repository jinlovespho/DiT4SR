The image is a blurry view of a city street with many cars parked on the side of the road. There are at least 13 cars visible in the scene, with some parked closer to the foreground and others further back. The street appears to be a one-way road, with cars parked on both sides.

In addition to the cars, there are two people visible in the scene, one near the center and the other towards the right side of the image. The presence of these individuals suggests that the street is a busy urban area.
