The image features a storefront with a sign that reads "Wild Hare." The store appears to be a restaurant or a shop, as there are several books visible in the window display. The books are arranged in various positions, with some closer to the front and others further back in the display. The storefront is located on a street corner, and the overall scene is blurry, making it difficult to discern more details.
