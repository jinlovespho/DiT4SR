The image shows two cars parked on the side of a street. One car is a black sedan, and the other is a black SUV. The street appears to be empty, with no other vehicles or pedestrians visible.

There are several traffic signs in the scene, including a stop sign located near the center of the image. Additionally, there are two parking meters, one closer to the left side of the image and the other near the right side. The presence of these traffic signs and parking meters suggests that this is a regulated parking area.
