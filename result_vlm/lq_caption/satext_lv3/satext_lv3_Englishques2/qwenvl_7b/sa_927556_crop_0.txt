The image shows a sign with some English text and Chinese characters. The English text appears to be "Hiking Trail" followed by what seems to be a number, possibly "1". The Chinese characters above the English text read "大峡谷" which translates to "Grand Canyon". Below the English text, there is another line that includes "Hiking Trail" again, followed by a number, possibly "2", and more Chinese characters that are not fully legible due to the blurriness.
