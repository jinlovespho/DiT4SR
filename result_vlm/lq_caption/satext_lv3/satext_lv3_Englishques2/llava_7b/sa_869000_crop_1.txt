The image is blurry, but it shows a street sign with the word "Biscayne" written on it. The sign is located near a tall building, and there are multiple traffic lights in the scene. The traffic lights are positioned at different heights and angles, with one being closer to the left side of the image, another in the middle, and the third one on the right side.
