The image is blurry, but it appears to be a storefront with a sign that reads "Sally Waters." The storefront features a building with a window and a door. There are two umbrellas in the scene, one located near the center and the other towards the right side. The presence of these umbrellas suggests that the storefront might be a shop or a cafe.
