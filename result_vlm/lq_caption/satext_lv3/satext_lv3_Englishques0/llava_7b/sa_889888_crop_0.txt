The image features a large pink and white airplane with the word "Virgin" on the side. The airplane is parked on the runway, and there are several orange cones placed around the area. The cones are positioned at various distances from the airplane, with some closer to the front and others further back. The scene suggests that the airplane is either preparing for takeoff or has recently landed, and the cones are there to guide or warn people in the vicinity.
