The image features a large wooden boat floating on a body of water, possibly a river or a canal. The boat is situated in front of a building with several windows. There are two people visible in the scene, one near the left side of the boat and the other closer to the right side.

In addition to the boat and people, there are two cars parked nearby, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the scene. A handbag can also be seen placed on the ground, closer to the right side of the boat.
