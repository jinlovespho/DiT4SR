The image features a large building with many windows. There are two people walking in front of the building, one closer to the left side and the other further to the right. A person is also walking near the building on the right side.

In the foreground, there is a street light with a sign attached to it. The sign reads "South Shore Line." The scene appears to be a city street with pedestrians going about their day.
