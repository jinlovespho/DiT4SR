The image features a white room with a wooden floor. There are four objects in the room, each with a different shape and size. The objects are placed in a line, with one on the left side, one in the middle, one on the right side, and the last one at the far right. The objects are not clearly identifiable, but they appear to be part of a display or an art installation.
