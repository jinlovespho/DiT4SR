The image features a sign with a combination of English and Hebrew text. The English text reads "Bet Shalom," which translates to "House of Peace." The Hebrew text is more extensive and covers the majority of the sign. The sign is attached to a fence, and the fence is covered in green plants, giving the scene a natural and serene atmosphere.
