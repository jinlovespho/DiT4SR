The image features a blue and white sign on a wooden pole. The sign has the number "5" on it, which is likely a reference to a parking space or a specific rule. The pole is located in front of a building, possibly a house, and is surrounded by greenery, including a bush and a tree. The scene appears to be a residential area with a focus on the sign and the wooden pole.
