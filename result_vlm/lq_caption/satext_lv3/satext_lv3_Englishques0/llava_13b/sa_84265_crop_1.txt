The image features a yellow and blue bus parked next to a brick wall. The bus is positioned near a body of water, possibly a river. There are several people in the scene, with some standing close to the bus and others scattered around the area.

In addition to the bus, there are two cars visible in the image. One car is located near the left side of the bus, while the other car is situated further to the left. The presence of the people and the vehicles suggests that this might be a busy location or a popular spot for public transportation.
