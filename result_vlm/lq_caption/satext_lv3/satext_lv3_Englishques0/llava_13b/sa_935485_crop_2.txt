The image features a long hallway with several white boards lining the walls. The boards have numbers on them, indicating that they are likely part of a ticketing system or a boarding area. There are at least 11 visible numbers on the boards, with some of them being larger than others.

In the hallway, there are three people walking by the boards. One person is located near the left side of the image, another person is in the middle, and the third person is on the right side. The scene suggests that these individuals might be waiting for their respective numbers to be called or looking for their designated boarding areas.
