The image features a large stone monument with a plaque on it. The plaque reads "Elihu Yale" and is located on the side of the monument. The monument is situated in a snowy area, with the snow covering the ground and the steps leading up to it. The scene gives a sense of a winter day, with the monument standing tall amidst the snowy landscape.
