The image features a small boat floating on a body of water, possibly a canal, in front of a red building. The boat is positioned close to the building, which has a window on the second floor. The scene appears to be in a foreign country, possibly Italy, as the boat is described as a gondola. The boat is docked in front of the building, creating a picturesque scene.
