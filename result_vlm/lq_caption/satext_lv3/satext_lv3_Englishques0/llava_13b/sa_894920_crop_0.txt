The image features a city street with a row of buildings, including a tall brick building with a large archway. There are several cars parked along the street, with one car parked in front of the building. A parking meter is located near the center of the scene, and a potted plant can be seen on the sidewalk.

In addition to the parking meter, there is a sign on the sidewalk, which reads "No Parking." The presence of this sign indicates that parking is not allowed in that particular area.
