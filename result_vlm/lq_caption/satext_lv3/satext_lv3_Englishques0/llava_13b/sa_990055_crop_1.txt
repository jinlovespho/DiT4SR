The image features a large white cruise ship with a yellow stripe on its side. The ship is docked at a pier, and it appears to be a luxury liner. The ship's name is "Carnival Glory," and it is a part of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. The ship is quite large, occupying a significant portion of the image, and it is surrounded by a few smaller boats.
