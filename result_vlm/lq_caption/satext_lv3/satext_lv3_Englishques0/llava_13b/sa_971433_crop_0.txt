The image features a harbor with several boats docked in the water. There are at least six boats visible, with some of them being closer to the shore and others further out in the water. 

In addition to the boats, there are several people scattered throughout the scene. Some of them are standing near the boats, while others are located closer to the shore. A few people can be seen in the background, possibly enjoying the view or attending to their boats.

There is also a car parked near the harbor, possibly belonging to one of the boat owners or visitors to the area.
