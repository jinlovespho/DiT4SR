The sign is white and reads "Presbyterian Hospital." The building is a tall, white structure with many windows, giving it a clean and modern appearance. The windows are arranged in rows, with some closer to the top of the building and others near the bottom. The building's facade is well-maintained, and the sign stands out as a clear and easily readable feature.
