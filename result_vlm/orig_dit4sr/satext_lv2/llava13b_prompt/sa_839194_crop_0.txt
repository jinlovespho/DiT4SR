The image features a large boat docked at a pier. The boat is situated in the middle of the scene, with a bridge visible in the background. The pier extends out into the water, providing a clear view of the boat.

There are several people scattered around the pier, some closer to the boat and others further away. They seem to be enjoying their time near the water, possibly admiring the boat or simply taking in the view.
