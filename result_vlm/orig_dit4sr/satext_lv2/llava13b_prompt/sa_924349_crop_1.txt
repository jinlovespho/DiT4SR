The image features a large white airplane with blue accents, parked on a runway. The runway is surrounded by a grassy area, giving the impression of a rural setting.

There are several people in the scene, likely airport staff or passengers. They are scattered around the airplane, with some standing closer to the front and others near the middle and rear sections of the aircraft. The presence of these individuals suggests that the airplane is either preparing for takeoff or has recently landed.
