The image features a large white building with a red roof, which appears to be a hotel. There are several windows on the building, with some of them having awnings.

In the foreground, there are two umbrellas, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the building. These umbrellas are likely placed there for guests or visitors to use for shade or protection from the elements.
