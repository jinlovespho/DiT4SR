The image features a woman standing on a surfboard in the water, holding a sail attached to a mast. She is wearing a yellow shirt and appears to be enjoying her time on the water. There are several other people in the scene, some of them closer to the water's edge, while others are further away.

In addition to the woman with the sail, there are two other surfboards visible in the water, one near the left side of the image and the other closer to the center.
