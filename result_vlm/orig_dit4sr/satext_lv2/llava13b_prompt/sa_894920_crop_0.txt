The image features a city street with a row of parked cars lined up along the sidewalk. There are at least five cars visible in the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further back.

In addition to the cars, there are two potted plants in the image, one situated near the left edge of the scene and the other towards the right side. The presence of these plants adds a touch of greenery to the urban environment.
