The image features a large airplane flying through the sky. The airplane is predominantly white and green, with a teal stripe running along its side. The plane is flying high up in the sky, and its wings are visible, extending outwards from the body of the aircraft. The airplane appears to be a commercial jetliner, possibly a jumbo jet, as it soars through the air.
