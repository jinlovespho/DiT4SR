The image features a large brick building with a black sign hanging off the side of it. The sign is white and black, and it reads "Penta Hotel." The building is quite tall, with several windows visible on its facade. The windows are arranged in a row, with some closer to the top of the building and others near the middle and bottom sections. The overall appearance of the building suggests it could be a hotel or a commercial establishment.
