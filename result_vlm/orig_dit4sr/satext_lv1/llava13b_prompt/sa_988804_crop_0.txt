The image features a small town with a waterway running through it. There are two buildings situated on opposite sides of the waterway, with one being a pink building and the other being a white building.

In the foreground, there is a flock of birds gathered near the waterway. The birds are scattered across the scene, with some closer to the water and others further away. The presence of the birds adds a lively atmosphere to the scene, as they interact with the water and the surrounding environment.
