The image features a red van driving down a runway or tarmac. There is a person standing near the van, possibly observing or assisting with the vehicle.

In addition to the van, there is a traffic cone placed on the right side of the scene, closer to the front of the van. The cone is likely there to guide or control the movement of vehicles on the tarmac.
