The image features a large yellow train with a red stripe on the side, traveling down the tracks. The train is quite long, extending from the left edge of the image to the right edge. The train's front is visible, with the number 5330 on the side. The train appears to be a passenger train, as it is designed to carry people rather than cargo.
