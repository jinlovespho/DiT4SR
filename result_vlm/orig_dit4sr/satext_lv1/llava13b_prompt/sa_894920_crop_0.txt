The image features a city street with a row of parked cars lined up along the sidewalk. There are several cars of different sizes, including a truck parked near the center of the scene. The cars are parked in front of a building with a large archway, which appears to be a church.

In addition to the vehicles, there are two potted plants visible in the scene. A clock can also be seen on the left side of the image, mounted on a wall.
