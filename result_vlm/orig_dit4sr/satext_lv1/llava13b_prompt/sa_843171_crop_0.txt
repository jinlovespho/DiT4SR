The image features a large white building with a red roof, which appears to be a hotel. The building has a sign on it, possibly indicating the name of the establishment. There are several windows on the building, with some of them having red awnings.

In the foreground, there are two umbrellas, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the building. These umbrellas are likely placed there to provide shade or protection from the elements for guests or visitors.
