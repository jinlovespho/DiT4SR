The image features a large body of water with a city in the background. The city is situated on a hillside, and the water appears to be a bay or a lake. There are several boats of various sizes scattered throughout the water, some closer to the shore and others further out.

In the foreground, there is a rocky structure or a small island, which adds to the scenic beauty of the scene. The city's buildings can be seen in the distance, creating a picturesque backdrop for the water and the boats.
