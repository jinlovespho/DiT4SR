The image features a large white airplane parked on the tarmac at an airport. There are several people around the airplane, with one person standing close to the nose of the plane, and two others standing further away.

In addition to the people, there are two trucks visible in the scene. These trucks are likely providing support services to the airplane, such as refueling or maintenance.
