The image features two boats docked next to each other in a body of water. The first boat is a large, black boat, while the second boat is a smaller, white boat.

There are several people visible in the scene, with one person standing near the left side of the smaller boat, another person standing near the right side of the larger boat, and two more people standing closer to the center of the image. The presence of people suggests that they might be enjoying a day out on the water or attending to their boats.
