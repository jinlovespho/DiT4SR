The image features a large boat floating on a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The boat is surrounded by a number of shipping containers, which are stacked on top of each other and appear to be in the process of being loaded onto the boat. The boat itself is quite large, occupying a significant portion of the image, and the containers are scattered around it, filling the space between the boat and the water.
