The image features a large building situated next to a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The building is a hotel, as indicated by the presence of several cars parked in front of it. There are at least six cars visible in the scene, with some parked closer to the building and others further away.

In addition to the cars, there are two people in the scene, one standing near the center of the image and the other closer to the left side. The presence of the water and the hotel suggests a relaxing and picturesque setting for visitors.
