The image features a harbor filled with numerous boats of various sizes. The boats are docked in the water, with some closer to the foreground and others further away. The harbor is situated near a city, with buildings visible in the background. The boats are arranged in a way that they are not too close to each other, allowing for a sense of openness in the scene.
