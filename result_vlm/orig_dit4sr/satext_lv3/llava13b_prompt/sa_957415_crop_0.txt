The image features a train track with gravel surrounding it. There are two sets of train tracks visible in the image, with one set closer to the foreground and the other set further in the background.

In addition to the train tracks, there are two traffic lights present in the scene. The presence of these traffic lights suggests that the train track may be near a road or a crossing point for vehicles.
