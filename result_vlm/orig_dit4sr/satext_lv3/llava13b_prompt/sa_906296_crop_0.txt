The image features a row of wooden benches, each with a blue and white striped canopy. The benches are arranged in a line, with some of them placed closer to the foreground and others further back. The canopies provide shade and protection from the sun, making them an inviting spot for people to sit and relax. The benches are placed on a gravel surface, which adds to the overall rustic and natural atmosphere of the scene.
