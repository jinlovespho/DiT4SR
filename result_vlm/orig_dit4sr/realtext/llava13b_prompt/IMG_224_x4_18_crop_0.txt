The image features a stack of three books, each with a red and white cover. The books are placed on top of each other, with the top book being slightly larger than the other two. The books are arranged in a way that they are all visible, with the top book covering the middle book and the middle book covering the bottom book. The books are likely of Asian origin, as they have Chinese writing on their covers.
