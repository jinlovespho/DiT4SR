The image features a wooden table with a variety of coffee-related items displayed on it. There are several cups of different sizes and shapes, with one cup placed near the center of the table and another cup towards the right side.

In addition to the cups and bowl, there are two leaves on the table, one near the center and the other towards the right side. The table appears to be a dining table, and the items on it suggest that it is set up for a coffee-drinking session or a gathering involving coffee.
