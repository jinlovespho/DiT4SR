The image features a wooden shelf with several small items hanging from it. There are five items in total, with each item being a different color. The items are arranged in a row, with one item hanging at the top left, another at the top right, one in the middle, one at the bottom left, and the last one at the bottom right. The shelf is placed against a wall, and the items seem to be hanging from a pegboard.
