The image features a display of four different colored yarn balls hanging on a wall. The yarn balls are arranged in a row, with each ball having a distinct color. The first yarn ball is on the left side of the display, the second is in the middle, the third is on the right side, and the fourth is at the far right end of the display. The arrangement of the yarn balls creates an aesthetically pleasing presentation.
